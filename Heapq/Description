Description:
This project demonstrates a simple max-heap construction and extraction algorithm implemented in C. It provides a menu-driven interface where users can:
- Create a heap from user-input elements
- Extract the maximum element (root of the heap)
- View the heap structure after each operation
The program uses an array-based representation of the heap and applies the heapify() procedure to maintain the heap property after insertion and deletion.
🔑 Features
- Interactive console menu (Create Heap, Extract, Exit)
- Efficient heap construction using bottom-up heapify
- Extraction of the maximum element with automatic re-heapification
- Supports up to 100 elements
🛠️ Tech Stack
- Language: C
- Concepts: Heap Data Structure, Array Representation, Heapify Algorithm
🚀 Usage
- Compile the program:
gcc heap.c -o heap
- Run the executable:
./heap
- Follow the menu prompts to create and manipulate the heap.
