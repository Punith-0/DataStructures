Binary Search Tree Implementation in C
This repository contains a simple implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C. It demonstrates fundamental operations on BSTs including insertion, deletion, and traversal.
🚀 Features
- Insertion: Add new nodes into the BST while maintaining order.
- Deletion: Remove nodes with proper handling of three cases:
- Node with no children
- Node with one child
- Node with two children (using inorder successor)
- Traversal Methods:
- Preorder (Root → Left → Right)
- Inorder (Left → Root → Right)
- Postorder (Left → Right → Root)
- Menu-driven program: Interactive console interface for performing operations.
🛠️ How to Run
- Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Punith-0/bst-c.git
cd bst-c
- Compile the program:
gcc bst.c -o bst
- Run the executable:
./bst


📂 File Structure
- bst.c → Main source code implementing BST operations.
- Future scope: Add unit tests, visualization, or balancing algorithms (AVL/Red-Black Trees).
🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Understand dynamic memory allocation with malloc and free.
- Learn recursive tree traversal techniques.
- Practice implementing deletion logic with inorder successor.
