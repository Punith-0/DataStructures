 ## 🥞 Stack SLL: The Pancake Protocol of Data Structures
Welcome to Stack SLL — where data goes in like pancakes and comes out like regret. This is a singly linked list implementation of a stack, built for those who believe in Last-In-First-Out and living dangerously with pointers.
# 🍳 Features:
- push() — Adds a new pancake to the top of the stack. Syrup not included.
- pop() — Removes the top pancake. Hope you weren’t too attached.
- display() — Shows you the current pancake pile. Warning: may induce hunger.
🤹 Why Use This?
Because arrays are too mainstream, and recursion is just stackception. This stack is handcrafted with malloc, love, and a mild fear of segmentation faults.
## 🧠 Usage:
# gcc stack.c -o stack
# ./stack


Then sit back and enjoy the chaos as you push and pop your way to enlightenment.
🧹 Memory Management:
## We clean up after ourselves. Every pop() frees memory, unlike your browser tabs.
