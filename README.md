# 💥⚙️ **DATASTRUCTURES — MASTERING C ONE POINTER BUG AT A TIME**

Welcome to **Punith-0’s DataStructures**, the ultimate C-powered playground where arrays stretch, stacks collapse, and pointers occasionally point to enlightenment (or `NULL`, depending on your luck).

This repo chronicles my journey from basic array acrobatics to full-blown pointer wizardry — all in **pure C**, no training wheels, no abstractions, just raw logic and caffeine-fueled debugging. 💪

---

## 🚀 **OVERVIEW**

This project is a growing library of clean, modular, and well-commented C implementations of essential data structures and algorithms. The goal? To build a rock-solid foundation in DSA using C — one pointer bug at a time 😅.

## 🗂️ **FILE HIGHLIGHTS — THE CODE ZOO**

| 🗃️ **File**                | 🤹 **What It Does**                                           |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Singly Linked list.c`    | Insert, delete, and display nodes like a one-way train of data |
| `hello main.c`            | The friendly neighborhood driver file that kicks things off    |
| `Evaluate postfix.c`      | Crunches postfix expressions like a calculator with attitude   |
| `GCD.c`                   | Finds the greatest common divisor — number friendship goals    |
| `Palindome.c`             | Checks if your string is a palindrome. Works on taco cats too  |
| `Queue integers.c`        | A queue that queues like a British citizen. FIFO all the way   |
| `Stacks inetgers.c`       | Push, pop, and pray. A classic LIFO stack of integers          |
| `Tower of henoi.c`        | Move disks, break minds. The OG brain-bender                   |
| `infix to postfix.c`      | Converts infix to postfix so your compiler doesn’t cry         |

## ⚙️ **HOW TO USE**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Punith-0/DataStructures.git
cd DataStructures
gcc filename.c -o output
./output

Each file is sprinkled with comments to guide you through the logic, edge cases, and occasional existential crises.

🤝 CONTRIBUTING
Got a better way to reverse a linked list? Want to optimize a queue? Found a bug that’s been haunting your dreams?
Open an issue or pull request — let’s build the cleanest, quirkiest C DSA library on GitHub. 🚀

☕ FINAL THOUGHTS
Learning DSA in C is like learning to swim by being dropped into the deep end — terrifying at first, but incredibly rewarding once you get it.
“In C, you don’t just write code — you command the machine.”

Stay tuned — more data structures and algorithms coming soon, one pointer bug at a time! 🧠💻
