⚙️ DataStructures — Mastering C One Pointer at a Time

Welcome to Punith-0’s DataStructures, a C-based repository exploring the core building blocks of programming: Data Structures and Algorithms.

This repo documents my journey from writing basic array manipulations to understanding how memory, pointers, and logic come together to form efficient programs — all in pure C, no shortcuts, no abstractions, just raw code and brainpower. 💪

🚀 Overview

This project contains clean, modular, and well-commented C implementations of essential data structures.
The goal is simple — to build a strong foundation in DSA using C, one pointer at a time (and occasionally debug a few segfaults along the way 😅).

📦 Current Progress
Category	Topics	Status
🧩 Basics	Arrays, Linked Lists	🚧 In Progress
🔁 Linear Data Structures	Stacks, Queues	✅ Completed
🌳 Non-Linear Data Structures	Trees, Graphs	🚧 In Progress
⚡ Algorithms	Searching, Sorting	🚧 In Progress
🔒 Advanced Topics	Hash Tables, Heaps, Graph Algorithms	🚧 In Progress
💡 Learning Goals

Understand how data structures work internally

Strengthen pointer logic and memory management

Write efficient and readable C code

Develop a base for algorithmic problem-solving

⚙️ How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Punith-0/DataStructures.git


Navigate into the folder:

cd DataStructures


Compile and run any program using GCC:

gcc filename.c -o output
./output


Each file includes comments to explain logic, edge cases, and step-by-step operations.

🧠 Topics Covered (and Coming Soon)

🤝 Contributing

Suggestions, optimizations, or new implementations are always welcome!
If you’d like to collaborate or share ideas, feel free to open an issue or pull request. Let’s build a clean and complete C DSA library together. 🚀

☕ Final Thoughts

Learning DSA in C is like learning to swim by being dropped into the deep end — terrifying at first, but incredibly rewarding once you get it.

“In C, you don’t just write code — you command the machine.”

Stay tuned — more data structures and algorithms coming soon, one pointer bug at a time! 🧠💻
