🧵 Singly Linked List: The One-Way Rollercoaster of Data
Welcome to the Singly Linked List Simulator — where data rides in one direction and memory management is a thrill ride!
This C program lets you:
- 🚀 Insert nodes at the beginning (because why not start strong?)
- 🐢 Insert nodes at the end (for those who like a slow build-up)
- 🧹 Delete nodes from the beginning (clean slate vibes)
- 💣 Delete nodes from the end (dramatic exits only)
- 👀 Display the list (because visibility matters)
Perfect for:
- CS students who love pointers more than pizza
- Debuggers who whisper sweet nothings to malloc
- Anyone who thinks struct node is a lifestyle
Warning: May cause sudden appreciation for memory allocation and a deep emotional bond with NULL.
