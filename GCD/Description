Summoned Euclid from the grave to do math for us

🤓 Description:
This majestic piece of code performs the ancient ritual of finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using recursion so elegant, eso elegant, even your math teacher would shed a tear.
- Prompts the user like a polite wizard: “Enter the numbers, mortal.”
- Recursively divides and conquers like a gladiator in a math arena.
- Returns the GCD with the confidence of a calculator that’s been through therapy.
Warning: May cause sudden urges to factor numbers at parties. Use responsibly.
