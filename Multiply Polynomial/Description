🧙 Polynomial Multiplication — Now with 100% More Linked List Magic
Welcome to the land where polynomials meet pointers and multiplication becomes a memory-efficient adventure. This C program doesn’t just multiply polynomials — it does so with the elegance of a doubly-linked wand and the precision of a math nerd at a coffee shop.

🔍 What’s Inside?
- A custom node struct that stores coefficient (co) and power (po) — because math deserves structure.
- insertend() to line up terms like polite guests at a polynomial party.
- display() that prints your polynomial like it’s auditioning for a math textbook.
- multiply() that cross-multiplies every term like a matchmaking algorithm for monomials.
- addterm() that combines like terms — because redundancy is so last semester.

🛠️ How to Run
gcc polynomial.c -o polynomial
./polynomial


Then input your polynomial terms. The program will multiply them faster than you can say “binomial expansion.”

🎯 Why Use This?
- Great for learning linked lists, dynamic memory, and polynomial operations.
- Perfect for students who want to impress professors with clean code and clever logic.
- Bonus: No zero-padding, no array headaches — just pure pointer-powered math.
